    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>My first poker simulation was created in Python, where it accepts any number of players from the command line and accordingly prompts the user for their names. It then creates a list from the user input and passes it onto another class, Game, where the winner is determined. In the Game class, a deck is constructed as a list of tuples where each tuple represents a card. A tuple is made up of its number and suit. Each player then randomly receives 5 cards, or tuples using the random.choice function, and the deck consequently pops that card. Afterward a dictionary is constructed with the players&rsquo; names as keys and their list of cards or hand as the players&rsquo; value. As of right now, a high card functionality has been given to evaluate the high card for each player and return the winner. In the future, I will add every possible way to win a game, including straights, flushes, etc.</p>
